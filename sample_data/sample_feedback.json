{"feedback" : ["it's better to explain in 2 languages, namely English and Indonesian, because some English I don't understand",
"The instruture was going fun so far because on the long time of class, she give 8 minutes time to us for take a short brake to refresh our mind",
"Nothing to add. use easy-to-understand language. Be proposional of the usage of the time and clearly talk some point. Maybe it will be better if the instructor does the practices in the slides!. maybe she should change the youtube video on how we should manage the our activities. It's because the video seems quite old and the audio is kinnda bad. from my experience so far, the instructor is bringing the topic very clear, fun, and talkative so i think i don't have any complain for the instructor. Maybe you can keep up the good work",
"Learn more about word pronunciation because I think she made some mistakes, but it still understandable and the material is good",
"maybe we can have a bit longer discussion so the instructor can share a bit longer life experience so we can take a lesson on that experience",
"The instructor give the best presentation. The way she teach us about stress management is also great just because she explained very well and not just about ppt. I think that you must be brave to pick someone when your participant hesitate to unmute their microphone."]}
